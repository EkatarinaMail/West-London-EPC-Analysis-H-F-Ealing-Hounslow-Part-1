Project Title: West London EPC Analysis (H&F, Ealing, Hounslow) Part1
Project Overview: This project demonstrates data analysis techniques used to monitor residential energy efficiency across West London. The goal is to identify energy-rating distribution and regional trends to support the 2030 Net Zero housing targets..
Key Skills Demonstrated:
1. Data quality
Working with raw data in Power Query: analyzing column quality, fixing missing values in inspection dates, and normalizing text for consistent reporting.

2. Data modeling
Building a professional semantic model: setting up geographical data categories, hiding technical keys, and creating a custom "Borough > Postcode" hierarchy.
3. Data visualization
Designing an executive-level dashboard using official EPC color standards to show the share of energy ratings across the selected boroughs.
4. Data drill-through (Drill-down)
Enabling interactive deep-dive analysis, allowing users to explore energy performance from a high-level borough view down to specific postcode sectors.
Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, Power Query, UK EPC Open Data.
